# U.S.A. DECALS

## How to add decals to a tank?
In Tank Mechanic Simulator you can add decals to the tanks by using the Paint Room. All decals can be scaled and rotated by using the in-game mechanics.

## Where to download the mods?
You can download the American decals by clicking the button below:

## Where to put the downloaded mods?
After downloading the RAR file, you need to unpack it. After unpacking you'll find a README file as well in which all of this is explained one more time.

The **location for the decal mods** are by default on the following location:

    X:\Steam\steamapps\common\TankMechanicSimulator\TankMechanicSimulator_Data\StreamingAssets\Textures\Decals

In the game's decal folder you will find some sub-folders. One for each nation in the game and a general one. The respective location for the **American decals** is:

    X:\Steam\steamapps\common\TankMechanicSimulator\TankMechanicSimulator_Data\StreamingAssets\Textures\Decals\USA

## Donations?!
The work I put into this project is done with all my heart. I love tanks, I love the game and I love the developers behind the game, Degenerals. Nevertheless, I'm spending quite some time on this project and it would be much appreciated if you decided to give me a little something back, which will only benefit future projects.
